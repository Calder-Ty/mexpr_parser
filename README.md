# Mexp Parser

A simple, naive implementation of a parser for Microsoft PowerQuery M language. Useful for parsing the
queries made by PowerBI connectors. In conjunction with an XMLA connection to powerbi, this can be
used to derive the queries to data sources used by PowerBI.

## Specification

The parser uses the [grammar described by microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/m-spec-consolidated-grammar).
Not all of the specification is implemented yet.

## Features

TODO: Add a list of supported parts of the grammar.
